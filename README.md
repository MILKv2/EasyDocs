## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- A Cloudflare account (for deployment)

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MILKv2/easydocs
   cd easydocs
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized build in the `dist/` directory.

## Deployment

### Cloudflare Pages Setup

1. **Install Wrangler CLI** (if not already installed)
   ```bash
   npm install -g wrangler
   ```

2. **Authenticate with Cloudflare**
   ```bash
   wrangler login
   ```

3. **Deploy to Cloudflare Pages**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

### Environment Configuration

For production deployments, configure your environment variables and secrets using Cloudflare's secure methods:

1. **Using Wrangler for secrets**:
   ```bash
   wrangler pages secret put SECRET_NAME
   ```

2. **Using the Cloudflare Dashboard**:
   - Go to your Pages project
   - Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Environment variables
   - Add your production variables

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**: Never commit sensitive data like API keys, tokens, or passwords to version control. Use Cloudflare's built-in secrets management.
